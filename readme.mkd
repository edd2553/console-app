# 🧮 CLI Application in Node.js

---

This is a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) application for generating multiplication tables. It was built using **argument values** from `process.argv` — the parameters and options passed through the terminal.
We used file system to writhe the tables in a file.

The application demonstrates:

- 📦 Use of the `yargs` package to manage command-line flags and options
- 📁 Writing generated tables to a file using Node.js' built-in `fs` (File System) module
- 🧠 Application of **Use Case Principles** from **Clean Architecture**

This project is a practical exercise to deepen understanding of core **Node.js** features and command-line tooling.

## Concepts and some thoughts:

- use cases: From clean code principles,  
    - Summarizes all business logic of the application
    - Give us Separation of concerns
    - When Saving the file we may want to be agnostic about where to save the multiplication table, it
      can be save file, and it can recibe an instance that tells us where to save the file, with that implementation

- Auto invoke asynchronous function
- Testing: Always start from the smallest component to the biggest
- Spy on: Observe and track the behavior of functions or methods without altering their original implementation
