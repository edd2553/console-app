# 🧮 CLI Application in Node.js

---

This is a simple CLI (Command Line Interface) application for generating multiplication tables. It was built using **argument values** from `process.argv` — the parameters and options passed through the terminal.
We used file system to writhe the tables in a file.

The application demonstrates:

- 📦 Use of the `yargs` package to manage command-line flags and options
- 📁 Writing generated tables to a file using Node.js' built-in `fs` (File System) module
- 🧠 Application of **Use Case Principles** from **Clean Architecture**

This project is a practical exercise to deepen understanding of core **Node.js** features and command-line tooling.

## Concepts:

- use cases: 
    - Summarizes all business logic of the application
    - Separation of concerns
    - Built the table
    - Save file in file system without taking care of where to save the multiplication table
